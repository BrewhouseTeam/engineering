# Brewhouse Engineering Principles

The goal of this document is to highlight the principles behind our engineering practices.

## We write code for our peers

We care about the person who will have to read, debug or extend our code. We want them to have a good time. We take extra time to turn “code that works” into code that’s clean, explicit, simple, robust, confident and tested… obviously!

## We trust our peers

We trust our peers for making the best decisions and the best work they can.

## We experiment (bleeding edge)

We experiment with new shiny technologies, tools and languages. We challenge ourselves, get out of our zone of comfort and expand our horizon. That’s what Friday times are for.

## We ship good, old, stable

We ship software built on top of mainstream languages and tools that are stable and should be supported for years to come.

## We collaborate

We know where engineering fits in the big picture and do our best to collaborate with product owners, designers and customers. We explain our constraints in words anyone can understand.

## We make pragmatic decisions

When we evaluate decisions, we take into account the requirements, unknowns, experience, team, and deadlines. We know the tradeoffs implied by the decisions we make.

## We reflect

We take time to reflect on our practice and improve.

## We contribute

We acknowledge that we sit on shoulders of giants. We give back by contributing to open source. We share knowledge on our blog and on the Brewhouse Software Engineering Guidelines document.
